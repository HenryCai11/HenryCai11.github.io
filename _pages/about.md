Hi, I'm Min Cai (蔡旻). I'm an M.S. student graduated from Shenzhen University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Haodi Zhang](https://hdzhangust.github.io). Before that, I obtained my B.A. in Translation from Beijing Language and Culture University. Currently, I also work closely with [Dr. Ziniu Hu](https://acbull.github.io)

I have broad interests in NLP, particularly in understanding the mechanisms of neural Language Models (LM), and in turn, helping to better understand human nature. 

Specifically, my current research focuses on:
- **LLM understanding** (mechanistic interpretability, e.g., SelfControl) and **evaluation** (e.g., AvalonBench and DataSciBench).
- **LLM control/alignment** using representation engineering (e.g., SelfControl).
- **LLM game agents** that are capable of solving complex tasks (e.g., Strategist)
